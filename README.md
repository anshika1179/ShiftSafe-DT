## 🚀 Production Setup

ShiftSafe-DT now includes production hardening for secrets, admin auth, rate limiting, and health checks.

### 1. Configure Required Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to your deployment environment and set at minimum:

- `CRON_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (SHA-256)
- `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`
- `WORKER_SESSION_SECRET`

Optional but recommended:

- `DATABASE_URL` (Neon Postgres connection string)
- `NEON_QUERY_RETRIES` (default `2`, retries transient network failures)
- `NEON_QUERY_RETRY_DELAY_MS` (default `150`, exponential backoff base in ms)
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
- `AQICN_API_KEY`
- `OTP_DEMO_CODE` (demo environments only)

Data persistence now defaults to Neon Postgres when `DATABASE_URL` is set. Local SQLite fallback (`.data/shiftsafe.db`) is used only when `DATABASE_URL` is not configured.

### 2. Verify Core Production Endpoints

- Health check: `GET /api/health`
- Admin login/session: `POST /api/admin/login`, `GET /api/admin/session`
- Trigger automation: `GET /api/triggers/cron` (requires `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>`)

### 3. Security Controls Enabled

- HTTP-only signed admin session cookie
- Timing-safe secret comparisons
- Route-level rate limiting on sensitive APIs (register, claims, policies, triggers, OTP, admin login)
- Stronger fraud scoring with geofence and anomaly signals
- Trigger monitor run telemetry persisted for auditability

---

## ⚠️ Scope & Critical Constraints

- **Coverage Scope**: **Strictly LOSS OF INCOME ONLY.** The platform provides a financial safety net for lost wages due to external disruptions. It explicitly **excludes** coverage for health, life, accidents, or vehicle repairs.
- **Financial Model**: 100% **Weekly pricing basis** to perfectly match the payout cycle and cash flow of gig workers.

---

## 👥 1. Persona & Sub-Category Focus

**Sub-Category**: Food Delivery Partners (e.g., Zomato, Swiggy)

**Persona Strategy**:
Meet Ravi, a 32-year-old Food Delivery Partner in Mumbai. Ravi earns roughly ₹4,000 to ₹5,000 per week. He lives week-to-week and relies heavily on peak hours (lunch and dinner rushes). Any disruption during these hours severely impacts his weekly livelihood. When uncontrollable external disruptions occur, Ravi currently bears the full financial loss. ShiftSafe-DT is built to protect Ravi.

---

## 🌪️ 2. Core Disruptions & Parametric Triggers Defined (100% Automated)

To avoid the mistake of manual claims, we define specific **External Disruptions** that act as our parametric triggers for **automated payouts**:

| Event                     | Trigger                                     | Source API/Data               | Automation Logic                                             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heavy Rain & Flooding** | Rainfall > 50mm in a 2-hour window          | OpenWeatherMap API            | Automatic payout if GPS shows user in affected zone.         |
| **Extreme HeatWaves**     | Temperature > 42°C for 3+ consecutive hours | OpenWeatherMap / IMD API      | Triggered for peak shift hours (Lunch/Dinner).               |
| **Severe Pollution**      | AQI > 450 (Severe+) restricting visibility  | AQICN API                     | Auto-claim initiated based on real-time AQI health warnings. |
| **Platform Outages**      | Aggregator server down > 90 minutes         | Downdetector / Direct Ping    | Verified against external outage logs. No user input needed. |
| **Unplanned Curfews**     | Sudden zone closures/Section 144            | Government API / News Scraper | Triggered via geo-fencing the closed zones.                  |

---

## 🏗️ 3. System Architecture (Optimized for Automation & Speed)

ShiftSafe-DT is built on a robust, event-driven architecture designed to minimize latency and ensure zero-touch automated claims.

## 🔄 4. Requirement Details & Zero-Touch Workflow

**Scenario: The Unforgiving Monsoon (Heavy Rain Trigger)**

- **The Context:** An unseasonal downpour hits Ravi's operational zone in Mumbai just before the dinner rush. Delivering safely is impossible. He loses 30% of his daily earnings.
- **The 100% Automated Workflow:**
  1.  **Monitoring:** ShiftSafe-DT's backend continuously monitors the Weather API—**Ravi doesn't even need to open the app.**
  2.  **Activation:** The API registers > 50mm of rainfall. The parametric condition for "Heavy Rain" is met.
  3.  **Validation:** AI clarifies Ravi's active policy and verifies his GPS location trail to ensure he was actually working during the disruption.
  4.  **Instant Payout:** A predefined income-replacement payout is instantly credited to Ravi's registered account (via UPI).
- **Zero-Claim UX:** Ravi receives a notification: _"Heavy rain detected in your zone. ₹250 has been credited to your wallet for missed earnings."_ **No manual claim filing, no proof of loss required.**

---

## 💰 5. The Weekly Premium Model

Gig workers operate on weekly cash flows. ShiftSafe-DT aligns with their financial reality through a **Weekly Micro-Premium Model**.

- **Granular Payments:** Premiums are broken down into manageable weekly deductions (e.g., ₹15 - ₹25/week).
- **Synchronized Deductions:** Premiums are automatically deducted on the same day aggregator platforms process their weekly payouts, ensuring the worker never feels a cash crunch.
- **Dynamic Adjustments (Focused AI):** The weekly premium is not static. AI adjusts it based on local risk, ensuring the system remains affordable yet solvent.

---

## 🧠 6. Practical AI & ML Integration Strategy

_We avoid over-complicated AI by focusing on two high-impact, practical use cases._

- **1. Dynamic Premium Pricing (Predictive Risk Modeling):**
  - **Goal:** Calculate fair premiums.
  - **How it works:** Machine Learning (Regression/XGBoost) predicts the probability of a trigger event for the upcoming week based on historical patterns.
- **2. Intelligent Fraud Detection (Anomaly Detection):**
  - **Goal:** Prevent GPS spoofing and duplicate claims WITHOUT slowing down genuine users.
  - **How it works:** Unsupervised ML (Isolation Forests) monitors user behavior (typical route logic, speed, login consistency) to ensure the rider was actually in the disaster zone.

---

## 💻 7. Premium UI Prototype & Demo Focus

_Note: For Phase 1, we focus on a High-Utility, Clean Mobile UI to avoid the "Bad UI" pitfall._

**Core Screens & Demo Walkthrough:**

1.  **Signup/Onboarding:** 10-second verification.
2.  **Intuitive Dashboard:** A "Protection Shield" visual showing active weekly coverage and current risk level.
3.  **One-Click Policy:** Transparent weekly pricing with zero hidden terms.
4.  **Live Claim Demo:** A simulated phone notification showcasting the **Auto-Payout sequence** (Disruption Detected -> Payout Triggered -> Money in Bank).

## 🎯 Phase 2 Problem Statement

> _"How can we build a fully automated, zero-paperwork income protection system for India's 30M+ gig workers — one that is actuarially sustainable, transparent in pricing, and settles payouts in under 2 minutes?"_

ShiftSafe-DT Phase 2 transforms the Phase 1 ideation into a **production-grade, executable platform** with five purpose-built engines, a mobile-first glassmorphism UI, 8 RESTful API endpoints, 9 database tables, and a fully simulated end-to-end claim pipeline:

| Engine                     | Purpose                                          | Key Metric                                        | Source                                                                 |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧮 **Premium Engine v3.0** | Formula-based parametric pricing with city pools | `P(trigger) × avg_income_lost/day × days_exposed` | [`premium-engine.ts`](backend/src/engines/premium-engine.ts)           |
| 📋 **Underwriting Engine** | Activity-based eligibility + tier classification | Min 7 active delivery days                        | [`underwriting-engine.ts`](backend/src/engines/underwriting-engine.ts) |
| 📊 **Actuarial Engine**    | BCR monitoring + sustainability alerts           | Target BCR: 0.55–0.70                             | [`actuarial-engine.ts`](backend/src/engines/actuarial-engine.ts)       |
| 💸 **Settlement Engine**   | 5-step zero-touch payout pipeline                | Settlement < 2 minutes                            | [`settlement-engine.ts`](backend/src/engines/settlement-engine.ts)     |
| 🔍 **Fraud Engine**        | Isolation Forest scoring (0–100)                 | Pre-payment check, 6-rule hybrid                  | [`fraud-engine.ts`](backend/src/engines/fraud-engine.ts)               |

Plus: **Historical weather-based risk intelligence**, **2 live stress test scenarios**, and **judge-facing Actuarial Command Center**

## ✅ Phase 2 Mandatory Requirements — 100% Implemented

|  #  | Requirement                     | Implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |            API            | Status |
| :-: | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------: | :----: |
|  1  | **Registration & Login**        | Frictionless onboarding (Phone → OTP verification → Profile) with **city selection**, **dynamic zone dropdowns**, **bank/UPI payout methods**, and **coverage plans (Basic/Medium/Pro)**. OTP verification is now server-side and controlled via environment configuration for production-safe deployments. |   `POST /api/register`    |   ✅   |
|  2  | **Platform Auth & Active Map**  | The user logs into their simulated gig app dashboard. A **Live Monitoring** tab displays the user's real-time zone activity map, allowing them to capture conditions and seamlessly submit incident screenshots for claims.                                                                                 |            N/A            |   ✅   |
|  3  | **Actuarial Pricing Engine**    | The policy premium is modeled live, adjusting automatically to historical disruption data for the selected zone, platform, and worker risk data.                                                                                                                                                            |    `GET /api/premium`     |   ✅   |
|  4  | **Policy Premium Payments**     | Under the policy management section, users can upload their _Payment Receipt_ to simulate purchasing premium manually, with a detailed **Payment History** and receipt download functionally.                                                                                                               | `GET/PATCH /api/policies` |   ✅   |
|  5  | **Automated Parametric Engine** | The engine checks the external API. If the `zone` mapped matches an API condition (e.g. `clear`), coverage is active. If `closure` is detected, a claim is flagged, and the disruption amount is computed analytically based on normal working hours.                                                       | `GET /api/triggers/cron`  |   ✅   |
|  6  | **1-Click Settlement / Payout** | The worker is notified via SMS/App Notification, bypassing traditional claims assessors. Payment drops immediately to the simulated target (Bank / UPI).                                                                                                                                                    |  `GET/POST /api/claims`   |   ✅   |
|  7  | **Admin Command Center**        | A fully functioning administrative dashboard **secured via email/PIN authentication**, showing platform stats, API health, fraud flagging scores, and global overrides for stress testing (e.g., triggering global risk events).                                                                            |   `frontend/app/admin`    |   ✅   |

### 🔬 Phase 2 AI/ML Enhancements (Judge Update)

To strengthen our Phase 2 judging readiness, we added a deeper explainability layer and a new interactive AI/ML experience:

- **AI/ML Lab (New Interface Tab in `/analytics`)**
  - Scenario-based premium simulation with live inputs (city, income, forecast, activity, claims history).
  - Shows **model confidence score**, volatility-driven anomaly signals, and **next-week payout prediction band** (optimistic / baseline / stressed).

- **Premium Engine Intelligence Upgrade**
  - Added deterministic ML-style diagnostics:
    - `fraudProbability`
    - `weatherRiskVolatility`
    - `anomalyDetected`
  - Added confidence model output:
    - confidence score + label (low/medium/high)
    - explainable rationale entries for judge transparency.

- **Operational Model Health Integration**
  - `/api/ml/health` now powers live model diagnostics in UI.
  - Runtime self-test and telemetry are shown separately to avoid false negative model signals during transient infra/network issues.

- **UI Refresh for Analytics Experience**
  - New high-signal cards and diagnostics surfaces for judges.
  - Better visual hierarchy for risk, confidence, and explainability outputs.

- **India-Market Readiness Hardening (New)**
  - Canonical city normalization for Indian aliases (`Bangalore` → `Bengaluru`, `Gurgaon` → `Gurugram`, `Delhi NCR` → `Delhi`) so actuarial tiering and pool mapping stay accurate.
  - Stricter Indian mobile validation (10-digit numbers starting with 6-9) across register/login/OTP APIs and UI forms.

- **Live GPS Verification Flow (New)**
  - Added `/api/gps/verify` to compare worker device coordinates with mapped zone coordinates.
  - Monitoring page now performs browser GPS checks, surfaces distance + accuracy, and passes GPS telemetry to fraud scoring during claim filing.

**Key files involved:**

- `backend/src/engines/premium-engine.ts`
- `backend/src/utils/india-market.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/premium/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/ml/health/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/gps/verify/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/analytics/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/monitoring/page.tsx`

### What is still manual (cannot be auto-done safely)

- Allow browser location permission during demo so live GPS verification can run on `/monitoring`.
- Set production secrets (`CRON_SECRET`, `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`, `WORKER_SESSION_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`) in deployment environment.
- Configure optional oracle keys (`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`, `AQICN_API_KEY`) for real-world triggers beyond simulation mode.

## 🧮 Engine 1: Premium Pricing — Parametric Model v3.0

### The Exact Formula

```
Base Premium = trigger_probability × avg_income_lost_per_day × days_exposed
Adjusted     = Base × seasonal_multiplier
Tier Premium = mapped to nearest fixed tier (₹20/₹35/₹50)
Final        = Tier Premium × (1 - city_tier_discount)
```

### How Each Variable Is Calculated

| Variable                  | Formula                                     | Example (Mumbai, ₹4200/week)                       |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `trigger_probability`     | `1 - Π(1 - P_peril)` for all perils in city | `1 - (0.70)(0.90)(0.92)(0.94)(0.97)` = **0.4715**  |
| `avg_income_lost_per_day` | `(weekly_income ÷ 7) × 0.70`                | `(4200 ÷ 7) × 0.70` = **₹420/day**                 |
| `days_exposed`            | Days the worker actually worked that week   | **6 days**                                         |
| `seasonal_multiplier`     | City + month specific adjustment            | May-June Delhi: **1.30**, Jul-Sep Mumbai: **1.35** |
| **Raw Premium**           | All combined                                | `0.4715 × 420 × 6` = **₹1,188**                    |
| **Fixed Tier**            | Mapped to nearest tier                      | → **₹50/week (ShiftGuard Premium)**                |

### Trigger Probabilities (Weekly, Per City × Peril)

```
                    Delhi NCR          Mumbai
Pollution          P = 0.35           P = 0.08
Heatwave           P = 0.20           P = 0.10
Heavy Rain         P = 0.10           P = 0.30
Platform Outage    P = 0.05           P = 0.06
Curfew             P = 0.02           P = 0.03
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** These are hypothetical weekly probabilities based on historical patterns, NOT yearly averages. Weekly data is used throughout as per hackathon guidance.

### Fixed Premium Tiers

| Tier            | Weekly Premium | Max Payout/Week | Min Activity Days | Covered Events                    |
| :-------------- | :------------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :-------------------------------- |
| 🟢 **Basic**    |      ₹20       |     ₹1,000      |         5         | Rain, Heatwave                    |
| 🔵 **Standard** |      ₹35       |     ₹2,000      |         7         | Rain, Heatwave, Pollution, Outage |
| 🟣 **Premium**  |      ₹50       |     ₹3,000      |         7         | All events including Curfew       |

**All tiers enforce a hard 50% maximum payout cap** — a worker earning ₹4,200/week can never receive more than ₹2,100 in payouts regardless of tier.

## 📋 Engine 2: Underwriting — Who Gets Covered

### Eligibility Rules

```
IF total_active_delivery_days < 7 → INELIGIBLE (need more history)
IF platform NOT IN [Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon Flex, Blinkit, Zepto] → REJECTED
IF days_active_in_last_30 < 5 → downgrade to Basic tier
```

### Activity Tier Classification

| Days Worked This Week | Total Active Days | Assigned Tier |
| :-------------------: | :---------------: | :------------ |
|          6–7          |        ≥ 7        | 🟣 Premium    |
|           5           |        ≥ 7        | 🔵 Standard   |
|          < 5          |        ≥ 7        | 🟢 Basic      |
|          Any          |        < 7        | ❌ Ineligible |

### City Pool Assignment

```
Delhi NCR (Delhi, Gurugram, Noida) → delhi_aqi pool   (AQI + heatwave heavy)
Mumbai Metro (Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai) → mumbai_rain pool (monsoon heavy)
```

Workers in the same city pool share a common risk profile, but premiums vary by individual activity.

### 5-Step Onboarding

```
Step 1: Platform verification (Zomato/Swiggy/etc.)
Step 2: Activity history check (min 7 active days)
Step 3: Activity tier classification (Basic/Standard/Premium)
Step 4: City pool assignment (Delhi AQI / Mumbai Rain)
Step 5: Plan recommendation + premium quote
```

## 📊 Engine 3: Actuarial Intelligence — BCR & Sustainability

### Burning Cost Rate (BCR)

```
BCR = Total Claims Paid ÷ Total Premium Collected
```

| BCR Range |   Status    | Action                                         |
| :-------: | :---------: | :--------------------------------------------- |
|  < 0.55   |  💰 Strong  | Consider lowering premiums for better adoption |
| 0.55–0.70 |  ✅ Target  | Healthy zone — 65 paise per ₹1 goes to payouts |
| 0.70–0.85 | ⚠️ Warning  | Review pricing or tighten trigger thresholds   |
|  > 0.85   | 🚨 Critical | **Suspend new enrollments immediately**        |

### Stress Scenario 1: 40-Day Monsoon (Mumbai)

| Parameter                 | Value       | Rationale                              |
| :------------------------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Duration                  | 40 days     | Typical monsoon intense period         |
| Trigger frequency         | 65% of days | Based on Mumbai rainfall patterns      |
| Avg payout/trigger/worker | ₹450        | Heavy rain payout tier                 |
| Participation rate        | 80%         | Not all workers claim every day        |
| **Result**                | BCR > 40    | **UNSUSTAINABLE without reserve fund** |

**Recommendation:** Suspend new enrollments 2 weeks before monsoon onset. Cap daily payouts at ₹350. Maintain reserve fund.

### Stress Scenario 2: Delhi May-June Heatwave + AQI

| Parameter                 | Value       | Rationale                                    |
| :------------------------ | :---------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Duration                  | 60 days     | May + June combined                          |
| Trigger frequency         | 40% of days | AQI > 300 or temp > 42°C                     |
| Avg payout/trigger/worker | ₹300        | Heatwave payout tier                         |
| Participation rate        | 75%         | Lower than monsoon                           |
| **Result**                | BCR > 16    | **UNSUSTAINABLE without dynamic thresholds** |

**Recommendation:** Implement dynamic trigger thresholds during peak months: AQI > 400 (not 300). Maintain separate reserve fund per city pool.

> **All assumptions are explicitly disclosed** in the UI for full transparency. Every scenario uses the same pricing formula — no hidden adjustments.

## 💸 Engine 4: Settlement & Payout Pipeline

### The 5-Step Zero-Touch Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant API as Weather/AQI Oracle
    participant SE as Settlement Engine
    participant FE as Fraud Engine
    participant DB as Database
    participant UPI as UPI/IMPS

    API->>SE: 1. Trigger Confirmed (rainfall > 50mm)
    SE->>DB: 2. Worker Eligibility Check (policy active, zone match, no duplicate)
    SE->>SE: 3. Payout Calculated (₹350 × 50% cap)
    SE->>FE: Fraud Score Check (BEFORE payment)
    FE-->>SE: Score: 8/100 CLEAN
    SE->>UPI: 4. Transfer Initiated (UPI primary, IMPS fallback)
    UPI-->>SE: Transaction Ref: UPI-TXN-8721634
    SE->>DB: 5. Record Updated (PolicyCenter + BillingCenter)
    Note over SE,UPI: Total time: < 2 minutes
```

### Payout Channels

| Channel                 | Priority | Settlement Time | When Used                                     |
| :---------------------- | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------------------------------------- |
| 📱 **UPI Transfer**     | Primary  |   < 2 minutes   | Worker already uses UPI daily — zero friction |
| 🏦 **IMPS to Bank**     | Fallback |   < 5 minutes   | If UPI ID not linked or UPI fails             |
| 💳 **Razorpay Sandbox** |   Demo   |   < 1 minute    | Hackathon simulation mode                     |

### Rollback Logic

```
IF UPI transfer fails:
  1. Auto-retry UPI once (timeout: 30s)
  2. IF retry fails → fallback to IMPS
  3. IF no fallback channel → flag for manual review (SLA: 4 hours)
  4. All failed attempts logged with reason code for audit
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Fraud check happens BEFORE payment**, not after — prevents clawback complexity
- **50% maximum payout cap** is enforced at the settlement level, not just the policy level
- **Transaction references** are generated per-channel for reconciliation
- **SMS confirmation** sent to worker after every successful settlement

### 🏗️ Architectural Decisions & Hackathon Trade-offs

_A transparent breakdown of what is live, what is simulated, and **why**, demonstrating production-level system design._

#### 1. "Explainable" AI vs. Black-Box LLMs

Instead of using Generative AI (LLMs) to determine financial risk—which is banned by financial regulators as a "black box" algorithm—we built a **Deterministic Heuristic Engine** (`actuarial-engine.ts`) and an **Anomaly Detection Matrix** (`fraud-engine.ts`) directly into our Node.js backend. This allows our risk calculations to instantly compute based on strict weights (City Tiers, Frequency Velocity, Seasonal Multipliers) without 3-second API latency. It proves mathematical explainability, which is mandatory for InsurTech.

#### 2. Frictionless Authentication (Demo-safe OTP with Production Guards)

**What:** OTP verification runs through a server endpoint with rate limiting and environment-based configuration.
**Why:** Demo environments can set `OTP_DEMO_CODE` for smooth walkthroughs, while production no longer relies on an in-browser hardcoded OTP value.

#### 3. Real Atmospheric Oracles vs. Simulated Events

**What:** We integrated live **OpenWeatherMap** (Satellites) & **AQICN** (Gov. Air Quality) APIs to read real-time environmental data via a Cron Job.
**Why:** If there is no real-world storm during our hackathon demo, our app shouldn't sit idle! We built a "Simulate Trigger" override so we can manually spawn localized weather events (e.g., 55mm Rain in Mumbai) to demonstrate the rapid payout pipeline to judges on command.

#### 4. The Settlement Pipeline (Razorpay / UPI)

**What:** The engine calculates exact payouts and logs `UPI-TXN-XXXXXX` receipts into the Neon Postgres database.
**Why:** We decoupled the actual financial `POST` request to UPI/Razorpay to avoid processing real money transfers during evaluation. The architecture proves the **Speed** of parametric settlement (< 2 seconds) while keeping the environment financially sandboxed.

#### 5. Food Aggregator Private Data

**What:** Users manually input their "Weekly Earnings" and "Days Active".
**Why:** Platforms like Zomato/Swiggy do not expose open OAuth APIs to read private rider data. In production, an aggregator partnership would auto-pull this data; for the hackathon, user-input simulate the data stream.

#### 6. Native Code Automation vs. Low-Code (n8n/Zapier)

**What:** We built an event-driven CRON and 5 native TypeScript engines instead of using visual workflow tools like n8n or Zapier.
**Why:** Parametric insurance requires executing complex mathematical models (Premium Engine) and high-speed fraud logic (Isolation Forests) _before_ processing payments. Low-code platforms introduce API latency and moving data between nodes poses security flaws for financial apps. Natively coding the automation in Next.js guarantees sub-2-second settlement speeds entirely within our own database loop.

## 🚀 Deployment — Full Stack Architecture

> **Live URL:** [https://shift-safe-dt-frontend-livid.vercel.app/](https://shift-safe-dt-frontend-livid.vercel.app/)

ShiftSafe-DT is a **monorepo** with two layers deployed as a single unified application on Vercel:

| Layer                   | Location                                      | Deployed As                                   |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend (UI)**       | `frontend/app/`                               | Next.js React pages (SSR + Client Components) |
| **Backend (5 Engines)** | `backend/src/engines/` + `frontend/app/api/`  | Next.js Serverless API Routes on Vercel       |
| **Database**            | Neon Serverless Postgres                      | Cloud-managed, auto-scales to zero            |
| **Automation**          | `.github/workflows/parametric-automation.yml` | GitHub Actions CRON (every hour, globally)    |

---

### 🏗️ How the Backend Is Deployed

> **There is no separate backend server.** The 5 insurance engines (`backend/src/engines/`) are pure TypeScript modules that are **imported directly by the Next.js API routes** (`frontend/app/api/`). Vercel bundles them together and deploys each API route as an independent **Serverless Function**.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        Vercel Serverless Functions               │
│                                                                  │

│  All engines ──query/write──▶ Neon Serverless Postgres (cloud)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each API call cold-starts one isolated Vercel Function (~80ms), runs the full engine pipeline (premium calc → fraud check → settlement), writes to Neon Postgres, and returns — all within **< 2 seconds**.

### 🗄️ Database — Neon Serverless Postgres

ShiftSafe-DT uses **Neon** as its cloud database, replacing the local SQLite used in development.

| Feature         | Detail                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Provider**    | Neon Serverless Postgres                                                     |
| **Connection**  | Pooled via `@neondatabase/serverless` driver (HTTP-based, no long-lived TCP) |
| **Schema**      | 9 tables auto-migrated on first deploy                                       |
| **Scale**       | Auto-scales to zero when idle — no cost for unused time                      |
| **Seeded data** | 4 demo workers (Ravi, Priya, Amit, Deepa) pre-loaded                         |

```bash
# Connection string format (set as DATABASE_URL on Vercel)
postgresql://user:password@ep-xxxx.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

### ⚙️ Automation Pipeline — GitHub Actions

ShiftSafe has **4 active GitHub Actions workflows** that automate the entire lifecycle:

#### 1. `parametric-automation.yml` — 🌦️ Hourly Oracle & Payout Engine _(Most Critical)_

This is the **core automation** that makes ShiftSafe zero-touch. It runs every hour and executes a **2-stage fallback pipeline**:

```
⏰ CRON trigger (every hour: 0 * * * *)
│
├── Stage 1: Hit /api/triggers/cron with Bearer token
│     ├── ✅ HTTP 200 → payouts processed, done
│     └── ⚠️ Non-200 → fall through to Stage 2
│
└── Stage 2: Fallback — POST /api/triggers (live oracle sweep)
      ├── Calls OpenWeatherMap API for real rainfall/temperature data
      ├── Calls AQICN API for real AQI readings
      ├── Evaluates parametric conditions for all active policies
      └── ✅ HTTP 200 → logs triggered event count
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/parametric-automation.yml (key config)
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 * * * *" # Every hour, 24/7, globally
  workflow_dispatch: # Can also be triggered manually from GitHub

env:
  PROD_URL: ${{ secrets.PROD_URL }} # = https://shift-safe-dt-frontend-livid.vercel.app
  CRON_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }} # Must match Vercel env var
```

> **Fork-safe:** If `PROD_URL` is not set (e.g. on a public fork), the workflow gracefully skips with a warning instead of failing. ✅

---

#### 2. `ci.yml` — 🔍 CI Pipeline (on every push/PR)

Runs **3 parallel jobs** on every push to `main`/`develop` and every PR:

| Job                   | What it does                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🔍 Code Quality**   | TypeScript type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) + ESLint across all `.ts/.tsx` files |
| **🏗️ Build**          | Full `next build` to verify the production bundle compiles without errors   |
| **🛡️ Security Audit** | `npm audit --audit-level=high` + TruffleHog secret scanning on every commit |

```
Push to main/develop
        │
        ├── ① Code Quality (typecheck + ESLint)
        │         ↓
        └── ② Build (needs ①) ──► ③ Security Audit (parallel)
```

#### 3. `release.yml` — 🎉 Auto Release (on `v*.*.*` tags)

When a version tag is pushed (e.g. `git tag v2.1.0 && git push --tags`), GitHub automatically generates a versioned release with changelogs.

#### 4. `pr-size.yml` + `auto-label.yml` — 📏 PR Hygiene

Auto-labels PRs by size (XS/S/M/L/XL) and applies category labels (frontend/backend/docs) based on changed files.

### 🔑 Required GitHub Secrets

Set these in **Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret        | Value                                             | Used By                     |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| `PROD_URL`    | `https://shift-safe-dt-frontend-livid.vercel.app` | `parametric-automation.yml` |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Same value as Vercel `CRON_SECRET` env var        | `parametric-automation.yml` |

> ⚠️ `CRON_SECRET` must be **identical** in both Vercel (env var) and GitHub (secret). A mismatch causes the automation to fall through to Stage 2.

---

### Environment Variables (Required on Vercel)

Set these in **Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**:

| Variable              | Required | Description                                               |
| :-------------------- | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        |    ✅    | Neon Serverless Postgres connection string                |
| `CRON_SECRET`         |    ✅    | Bearer token protecting `/api/triggers/cron`              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` |    ✅    | `https://shift-safe-dt-frontend-livid.vercel.app`         |
| `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | Optional | Live rainfall/temperature data (falls back to simulation) |
| `AQICN_API_KEY`       | Optional | Live AQI pollution data (falls back to simulation)        |

A full template is in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

---

### One-Command Local → Production Deploy

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# From the frontend directory
cd frontend
vercel --prod
# Vercel auto-detects Next.js, deploys all pages + API routes as serverless functions
```

After deploying:

1. Set all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Add `PROD_URL` and `CRON_SECRET` to GitHub Secrets
3. The hourly CRON starts automatically — **no further action needed** ✅

## 💼 Business Model — How ShiftSafe Makes Money

### Revenue Streams

| Stream                      | How It Works                                               | % of Revenue |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| **Premium Revenue**         | ₹20-₹50/week from each enrolled worker                     | 60%          |
| **Aggregator Partnerships** | B2B license fee per active rider covered                   | 25%          |
| **Data Insights**           | Anonymized risk analytics sold to city planners & insurers | 10%          |
| **Reinsurance Float**       | Interest on reserve fund corpus                            | 5%           |

### Unit Economics (Per Worker Per Month)

```
Revenue:
  Weekly premium (avg ₹35) × 4 weeks          = ₹140/month
  Aggregator subsidy (₹10/worker/month)        = ₹ 10/month
  Total Revenue                                = ₹150/month

Costs:
  Expected payouts (BCR 0.65 × ₹140)           = ₹ 91/month
  Payment processing (2% of payouts)            = ₹  2/month
  Tech infra (servers, APIs)                    = ₹  5/month
  Total Costs                                   = ₹ 98/month

  Gross Margin per Worker                       = ₹ 52/month (34.7%)
```

### Go-to-Market Strategy

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Pilot City**

- Partner with **1 aggregator** (Zomato or Swiggy) in Mumbai
- Target: **500 workers** enrolled via in-app integration
- Worker pays ₹0 for first 2 weeks (aggregator-subsidized trial)
- Validate BCR stays within 0.55-0.70 target

**Phase 2 (Months 4-8): Expand**

- Add Delhi NCR as second city pool
- Reach **5,000 workers** across both cities
- Launch Premium tier (₹50/week) for high-activity riders
- Begin selling anonymized risk data to municipal bodies

**Phase 3 (Months 9-12): Scale**

- Expand to 4+ metro cities (Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai)
- Target **50,000 workers** enrolled
- Apply for IRDAI sandbox license for parametric microinsurance
- Projected ARR: **₹8.4 Cr/year** (50K workers × ₹140/month × 12)

### Why Aggregators Will Partner

| Aggregator Pain Point                      | ShiftSafe Solution                            |
| :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| High rider churn during monsoon/heat       | Workers stay active knowing they're protected |
| PR risk from rider welfare criticism       | "We insure our riders" is powerful marketing  |
| No differentiation in rider benefits       | First-mover advantage — "insured fleet" badge |
| Regulatory pressure for gig worker welfare | Compliance-ready income protection            |

### Competitive Moat

1. **Parametric triggers** = no claims adjustment cost (other insurers spend 15-20% on claims processing)
2. **Weekly micro-premiums** = accessible to workers earning ₹4K-5K/week (traditional insurance requires monthly/annual commitment)
3. **City-tier risk pools** = 3-tier system (Metro/Urban/Emerging) for actuarially fair pricing across 11 cities
4. **Zero-touch UX** = 10x faster claim settlement than any traditional insurer
5. **Tier-based scaling** = conservative payout caps in Tier 2/3 cities protect reserves while growing market

### Implementation Status — All Engines Operational

#### 🤖 Engine 1: Fraud Detection (ML Pipeline)
- **Algorithm:** Isolation Forest (100 trees, max depth 10) — Liu, Ting & Zhou (2008)
- **Feature Engineering:** 15 features with **Z-Score standard scaling** to prevent feature dominance
- **Normalization Fix:** All features (distance 0-20km, GPS accuracy 0-400m, speed 0-120kmph) are mapped to Z-scores using population statistics before being fed to the forest. This ensures small-range binary features (duplicate, policy-inactive) have equal influence as large-range continuous features.
- **Hybrid Scoring:** 60% ML anomaly score + 40% rule-based severity bonus
- **Key file:** `backend/src/engines/fraud-engine.ts`

```
Feature Vector (15 inputs):
  F1:  GPS distance from zone centroid (km)     → Z-Score (μ=2, σ=4)
  F2:  GPS accuracy (meters)                    → Z-Score (μ=15, σ=20)
  F3:  Travel speed anomaly (km/h)              → Z-Score (μ=25, σ=15)
  F4:  Claim amount / daily average ratio       → Z-Score (μ=1.0, σ=0.5)
  F5:  Claims frequency (30d)                   → Z-Score (μ=1.0, σ=1.5)
  F6:  Duplicate-today binary                   → Z-Score (μ=0.05, σ=0.22)
  F7:  Policy-active binary                     → Z-Score (μ=0.05, σ=0.22)
  F8:  Time-of-day bucket (night = riskier)     → Z-Score (μ=12, σ=6)
  F9:  Platform Context (multi-zone logins)     → Z-Score (μ=0.02, σ=0.14)
  F10: Device ID Swaps (30d)                    → Z-Score (μ=0.5, σ=1.0)
  F11: Time since last claim (minutes)          → Z-Score (μ=43200, σ=21600)
  F12: Battery level (spoof apps force 100%)    → Z-Score (μ=45, σ=25)
  F13: App version integrity (binary)           → Z-Score (μ=0.01, σ=0.1)
  F14: Bank account mismatch (UPI vs Platform)  → Z-Score (μ=0.03, σ=0.17)
  F15: Altitude variance (GPS spoof = flat)     → Z-Score (μ=50, σ=30)
```

#### ⚡ Engine 2: Settlement Pipeline (5-Step Workflow)
- **Step 1:** Trigger detected → claim created in Firestore
- **Step 2:** Fraud score computed → if BLOCKED, claim rejected with full ML audit trail
- **Step 3:** Admin review queue (claims with score 45-69 auto-routed to human review)
- **Step 4:** Settlement channel selected: UPI (primary) → IMPS (fallback) → Sandbox
- **Step 5:** Transaction reference generated, settlement status tracked with timeline
- **Status tracking:** `pending` → `processing` → `completed` | `failed` | `rollback_available`
- **Key file:** `backend/src/engines/settlement-engine.ts`

#### 🏛️ Engine 3: Underwriting with Adverse Selection Lock
- **SS Code 2020:** 90-day single-platform / 120-day multi-platform engagement rule
- **DPDP Act 2023:** Three explicit data consents (GPS, Bank/UPI, Platform Activity)
- **Adverse Selection Lock:** Enrollment blocked during known disaster windows:
  - Delhi: Nov 1-15 (Diwali AQI crisis)
  - Mumbai: Jul 15 - Aug 15 (Monsoon peak)
  - Chennai: Nov 20 - Dec 10 (Cyclone season)
- **48-Hour Cooling Period:** New enrollments during active disasters start coverage 48hrs later
- **Key file:** `backend/src/engines/underwriting-engine.ts`

#### 💰 Engine 4: Dynamic Premium Pricing (City-Specific)
- **15 Indian cities** with individual risk profiles (not averaged pricing!)
- **Seasonal multipliers:** Mumbai Monsoon (1.35x), Delhi AQI Winter (1.40x), Chennai Cyclone (1.25x)
- **Income-linked:** Premium = base_risk × city_multiplier × seasonal_adjustment × income_band
- **15% operational buffer** baked into every premium calculation
- **Key file:** `backend/src/engines/premium-engine.ts`

#### 📊 Engine 5: Actuarial Command Center
- **BCR (Burning Cost Rate)** real-time monitoring with health thresholds:
  - < 0.55: Strong ✅ | 0.55-0.70: Target ✅ | 0.70-0.85: Warning ⚠️ | > 0.85: Critical 🚨
- **Stress Testing:** Simulates catastrophic scenarios (2x claims, 50% lapse)
- **Key file:** `frontend/app/actuarial/page.tsx`

#### 🔄 Engine 6: Automated CRON Trigger Monitoring
- **Vercel CRON:** Runs daily at midnight UTC (`vercel.json` → `/api/triggers/cron`)
- **Data sources (no API key required):**
  - **Open-Meteo** — Real-time weather (rain mm/hr, temperature °C)
  - **Open-Meteo Air Quality** — Real-time AQI and PM2.5
  - **Platform Health Probes** — HEAD requests to Zomato/Swiggy for uptime checks
- **Optional API keys (enhanced accuracy):**
  - `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` — OpenWeatherMap for hyper-local weather
  - `AQICN_API_KEY` — WAQI for official government AQI stations
- **Flow:**
  ```
  CRON fires (daily at midnight UTC)
    → Fetch all active policy zones from DB
    → For each zone: resolve GPS coordinates (Nominatim → city fallback)
    → Check weather trigger (Open-Meteo / OpenWeatherMap)
    → Check pollution trigger (Open-Meteo AQ / AQICN)
    → Check platform outage (live HTTP probes)
    → For each triggered event:
        → Find affected workers in that zone
        → Run fraud detection (Isolation Forest)
        → Create claim with fraud score + evidence trail
        → Route to admin review queue (or block if fraud score > 70)
    → Log run metrics to trigger_monitor_runs table
  ```
- **Key files:**
  - `frontend/vercel.json` — CRON schedule
  - `frontend/app/api/triggers/cron/route.ts` — Automation engine
  - `backend/src/services/triggers.ts` — External API integrations

## 🏛️ Regulatory Compliance — SS Code 2020 & DPDP Act 2023

### Social Security Code 2020 Implementation

The SS Code 2020 (Chapter IX, Sections 113-115) mandates social security for gig and platform workers. ShiftSafe-DT implements:

| Provision | Implementation | File |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| **90/120-Day Engagement Rule** | Single-platform workers need 90 active days; multi-platform (multi-apping) workers need 120 days before coverage | `underwriting-engine.ts:L82-97` |
| **Platform Worker Definition** | Only Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon Flex, Blinkit, Zepto workers qualify (Section 2(61)) | `underwriting-engine.ts:ALLOWED_PLATFORMS` |
| **State ID Eligibility** | Workers below threshold get specific warning with remaining days count | `underwriting-engine.ts:warnings[]` |
| **Activity-Based Tiering** | Workers with < 15 active days in 30 → Basic tier. Reflects Section 114 proportional coverage. | `underwriting-engine.ts:L103-111` |

### DPDP Act 2023 Implementation

The Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 requires explicit, informed consent for processing personal data. ShiftSafe implements:

| DPDP Requirement | How We Implement It |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Purpose Limitation (Section 4)** | Three separate consent flags: GPS location, Bank/UPI, Platform Activity — each explains why data is needed |
| **Consent (Section 6)** | Mandatory opt-in at registration. Underwriting rejects if any consent is `false` |
| **Right to Erasure (Section 12)** | Claims export API lets workers download all their data. Data portability enforced. |
| **Data Minimization** | We only track: zone location (not continuous GPS), transaction refs (not bank balances), activity days (not earnings details) |
| **Data Fiduciary** | ShiftSafe acts as data fiduciary with clear processing boundaries. No data shared with third parties without explicit consent. |

## 🎭 Storytelling Framework — The Zero-Touch Promise

> **Objective:** Humanize the ShiftSafe-DT algorithm to judges using emotions and relief.

### Act 1: The Person
> *"Meet **Ravi**. He's 28, driving for Swiggy in Karol Bagh, Delhi. He makes ₹18,000 a month to feed his family back in his village. Every rupee matters. There is no safety net."*

### Act 2: The Disruption
> *"It is a Tuesday evening in November. The CPCB issues a public health crisis order: AQI hits **430**. The government restricts non-essential delivery. Ravi is grounded for 3 days. He doesn't know when he can ride again."*

### Act 3: The Loss
> *"No deliveries means no money. Ravi loses exactly **₹1,800**. For him, this isn't just lost profit—it means missing this month's room rent due on Friday. His daughter's school fees are pending. The anxiety is crushing."*

### Act 4: The Protection (ShiftSafe in Action)
> *"But Ravi didn't file an application. He didn't submit a grievance. He didn't even open the app. Because he is covered by ShiftSafe-DT, our CRON engine autonomously detected the CPCB red-alert and matched it to his active Delhi Geo-zone within 30 minutes."*

**What happened behind the scenes:**
```
1. CRON detected AQI 430 via Open-Meteo Air Quality API     [0 min]
2. Matched 47 active policies in Delhi zones                  [0.1 min]
3. Fraud engine scored Ravi: 12/100 (CLEAN) ✓                [0.2 min]
4. Settlement engine generated UPI transaction                [0.5 min]
5. ₹1,200 transferred to Ravi's UPI (50% cap applied)        [1.0 min]
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total time: 1 minute. Zero human intervention.
```

### Act 5: The Relief
> *"On Wednesday morning, Ravi's phone buzzes. It's a notification: **'Parametric trigger activated. ₹1,200 transferred via UPI.'** Instead of despair, Ravi breathes a sigh of relief. He survives the week. He keeps riding next week. His family is okay."*
>
> *"**That** is the power of zero-touch automated insurance. No forms. No waiting. No middlemen. Just protection that works when you need it most."*

### 💡 Pitch Presentation Notes

| Technique | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Specificity over Generality** | "Ravi from Karol Bagh" — not "A Delivery Driver" |
| **Name the Number** | ₹1,800 lost → ₹1,200 recovered → ₹600 gap explained (50% cap) |
| **Show the Timeline** | 0 → 1 minute from detection to payout |
| **Emotional Arc** | Anxiety → Protection → Relief → Continuation |
| **LIC/Bajaj Allianz Parallel** | Borrow thematic cues from "Zindagi ke saath bhi, Zindagi ke baad bhi" — apply to gig economy |
| **Multiple Personas** | Ravi (Delhi, AQI), Priya (Mumbai, Rain), Karthik (Chennai, Cyclone) |
